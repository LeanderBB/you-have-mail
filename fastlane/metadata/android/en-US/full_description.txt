Small application to notify you when you receive an email in your email account.
This may be useful for cases where you only wish to be notified when your email
account has a new message and the default notification mechanism does not work
(e.g: Android without Google Play Services) or do not wish to have the web
interface/email client open at all times.

<b> Supported Backends </b>

The application structure has been made backend agnostics, so it should be possible to add
different providers in the future. Currently, the following email providers are supported:

* Proton Mail (Single Password Mode)
